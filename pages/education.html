            <h3>Mbita High School | Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) | 2012-01 - 2015-11</h3>
            <p>I graduated from Mbita High School in November 2015, where I developed a strong foundation in academics while actively participating in extracurricular activities. During my time there, I engaged in various clubs and competitions, including the National Level Science and Engineering Fair and the National Level Kenya Drama and Music Festival, where I showcased my creativity and problem-solving skills. Additionally, I was part of the County Level Scouts Inter Patrol Camping Competition, which enhanced my leadership and teamwork abilities. These experiences played a significant role in shaping my passion for engineering and innovation.</p>
