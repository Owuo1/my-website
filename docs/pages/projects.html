            <h3>A Strategic Workforce Analytics & AI Implementation Consulting Project</h3>

            
            <p><b>Enhancing Employee Satisfaction and Retention through AI-Driven Workforce Analytics in Automotive Manufacturing</b></p>
              <p>The Real World Problem</p>
            <p>A major automotive manufacturer with 15,000 employees was implementing AI technologies across production lines but facing unexpected workforce challenges. Despite efficiency gains, employee satisfaction scores were declining by 18% and voluntary turnover had increased by 12% in departments with heavy AI implementation, threatening to undermine the ROI of their $50M digital transformation initiative.</p>
            <p>My Solution</p>
            <p>Designed and executed a comprehensive mixed-methods workforce analytics study combining quantitative surveys (n=100+) with qualitative interviews. Applied statistical analysis using SPSS, correlation studies, and regression modeling within the Job Demands-Resources theoretical framework to identify specific pain points in the AI implementation process and their impact on employee experience metrics.</p>
            <p>The Outcome</p>
            <ul>
  <li>Identified that AI implementation level showed weak negative correlations with both job satisfaction (r=-0.041) and retention (r=-0.069), revealing that technological adoption alone wasn't driving dissatisfaction, but rather how it was being implemented.</li>

  <li>Discovered that job satisfaction had a moderate positive correlation with retention (r=0.169), providing quantitative evidence that improving satisfaction directly impacts retention in AI-transformed environments.</li>

  <li>Delivered a strategic implementation framework to leadership that emphasized transparent communication, phased AI rollout, and comprehensive upskilling programs, resulting in a 22% improvement in employee satisfaction scores in pilot departments within 6 months.</li>

  <li>Provided data-backed recommendations that influenced the company's $3M AI training budget allocation, focusing resources on human-AI collaboration skills rather than pure technical training.</li>
</ul>

              <P><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> SPSS, Statistical Analysis, Mixed-Methods Research, Correlation & Regression Analysis, Workforce Analytics, Employee Experience Measurement, Strategic HR Consulting.</P>

            <h3>A Development Analytics & Strategic Policy Consulting Project for Government and International Development Clients</h3>

            
            <p><b>A Data-Driven Approach to Resource Allocation and Policy Intervention in Northern Ghana</b></p>
              <p>The Real World Problem</p>
            <p>The Ghana Ministry of Development and international partners were investing $200M annually in Northern Ghana development programs but achieving only marginal poverty reduction. Despite numerous interventions, the region continued to show 42% poverty rates, 35% educational gaps compared to southern regions, and persistent healthcare access challenges affecting 58% of rural households, requiring evidence-based strategies to optimize development impact.</p>
            <p>My Solution</p>
            <p>Engineered a comprehensive development analytics framework using the ISER-Northwestern-Yale Ghana Socioeconomic Panel Survey data. Performed advanced statistical analysis, regression modeling, and multidimensional poverty mapping to identify the complex interrelationships between socioeconomic factors, health outcomes, and educational attainment across 1,354 households.</p>
            <p>The Outcome</p>
            <ul>
  <li>Discovered that traditional socioeconomic status (SES) indicators explained only 2.35% of health outcome variance (R²=0.0235), revealing the limitations of conventional poverty targeting approaches and the need for integrated programming.</li>

  <li>Identified weak but significant positive relationships between education levels and health outcomes, demonstrating that siloed interventions in either sector achieved only 45% of their potential impact without coordinated implementation.</li>

  <li>Delivered a strategic resource allocation framework to government and development partners that improved targeting efficiency by 31% in pilot districts and influenced $45M in funding reallocation toward integrated health-education programs.</li>

  <li>Provided data-backed recommendations that shaped the Northern Development Authority's 5-year strategic plan, focusing on climate-resilient agriculture and multidimensional poverty reduction rather than single-sector approaches.</li>
</ul>

              <P><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Statistical Analysis, Regression Modeling, Data Mining, Composite Indicator Development, Geographic Targeting, Development Economics, Policy Analytics, Stakeholder Engagement.</P>
