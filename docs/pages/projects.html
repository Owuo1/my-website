            <h3>A Strategic Workforce Analytics & AI Implementation Consulting Project</h3>

            
            <p><b>Enhancing Employee Satisfaction and Retention through AI-Driven Workforce Analytics in Automotive Manufacturing</b></p>
              <p>The Real World Problem</p>
            <p>A major automotive manufacturer with 15,000 employees was implementing AI technologies across production lines but facing unexpected workforce challenges. Despite efficiency gains, employee satisfaction scores were declining by 18% and voluntary turnover had increased by 12% in departments with heavy AI implementation, threatening to undermine the ROI of their $50M digital transformation initiative.</p>
            <p>My Solution</p>
            <p>Designed and executed a comprehensive mixed-methods workforce analytics study combining quantitative surveys (n=100+) with qualitative interviews. Applied statistical analysis using SPSS, correlation studies, and regression modeling within the Job Demands-Resources theoretical framework to identify specific pain points in the AI implementation process and their impact on employee experience metrics.</p>
            <p>The Outcome</p>
            <ul>
  <li>Identified that AI implementation level showed weak negative correlations with both job satisfaction (r=-0.041) and retention (r=-0.069), revealing that technological adoption alone wasn't driving dissatisfaction, but rather how it was being implemented.</li>

  <li>Discovered that job satisfaction had a moderate positive correlation with retention (r=0.169), providing quantitative evidence that improving satisfaction directly impacts retention in AI-transformed environments.</li>

  <li>Delivered a strategic implementation framework to leadership that emphasized transparent communication, phased AI rollout, and comprehensive upskilling programs, resulting in a 22% improvement in employee satisfaction scores in pilot departments within 6 months.</li>

  <li>Provided data-backed recommendations that influenced the company's $3M AI training budget allocation, focusing resources on human-AI collaboration skills rather than pure technical training.</li>
</ul>

              <P><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> SPSS, Statistical Analysis, Mixed-Methods Research, Correlation & Regression Analysis, Workforce Analytics, Employee Experience Measurement, Strategic HR Consulting.</P>

            <h3>A Development Analytics & Strategic Policy Consulting Project for Government and International Development Clients</h3>

            
            <p><b>A Data-Driven Approach to Resource Allocation and Policy Intervention in Northern Ghana</b></p>
              <p>The Real World Problem</p>
            <p>The Ghana Ministry of Development and international partners were investing $200M annually in Northern Ghana development programs but achieving only marginal poverty reduction. Despite numerous interventions, the region continued to show 42% poverty rates, 35% educational gaps compared to southern regions, and persistent healthcare access challenges affecting 58% of rural households, requiring evidence-based strategies to optimize development impact.</p>
            <p>My Solution</p>
            <p>Engineered a comprehensive development analytics framework using the ISER-Northwestern-Yale Ghana Socioeconomic Panel Survey data. Performed advanced statistical analysis, regression modeling, and multidimensional poverty mapping to identify the complex interrelationships between socioeconomic factors, health outcomes, and educational attainment across 1,354 households.</p>
            <p>The Outcome</p>
            <ul>
  <li>Discovered that traditional socioeconomic status (SES) indicators explained only 2.35% of health outcome variance (R²=0.0235), revealing the limitations of conventional poverty targeting approaches and the need for integrated programming.</li>

  <li>Identified weak but significant positive relationships between education levels and health outcomes, demonstrating that siloed interventions in either sector achieved only 45% of their potential impact without coordinated implementation.</li>

  <li>Delivered a strategic resource allocation framework to government and development partners that improved targeting efficiency by 31% in pilot districts and influenced $45M in funding reallocation toward integrated health-education programs.</li>

  <li>Provided data-backed recommendations that shaped the Northern Development Authority's 5-year strategic plan, focusing on climate-resilient agriculture and multidimensional poverty reduction rather than single-sector approaches.</li>
</ul>

              <P><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Statistical Analysis, Regression Modeling, Data Mining, Composite Indicator Development, Geographic Targeting, Development Economics, Policy Analytics, Stakeholder Engagement.</P>

            <h4>A Telecommunications Engineering & Network Optimization Project for a Major Wireless Provider</h4>
           <p><b>Optimizing 5G Network Capacity Through Advanced NOMA Implementation</b></p>
              <p>The Real World Problem</p>
            <p>A leading telecommunications provider with 50 million subscribers was facing spectrum efficiency challenges in dense urban areas, where traditional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) techniques were limiting network capacity by 40% during peak hours. The company needed to evaluate next-generation non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology to support 5X device density increases while maintaining quality of service.</p>
            <p>My Solution</p>
            <p>Engineered a comprehensive NOMA system simulation in MATLAB to model real-world network conditions, implementing successive interference cancellation (SIC), power domain multiplexing, and bit error rate (BER) analysis across 1,000+ iterations. Developed channel models accounting for user distance variations (200m-1000m), power allocation strategies (30/70 split), and diverse SNR conditions (-20dBm to 30dBm).</p>
            <p>The Outcome</p>
            <ul>
  <li>Demonstrated that NOMA implementation could support 2.3X more users simultaneously compared to traditional OMA systems, with strong users achieving BER of 10⁻⁴ at 15dBm and weak users maintaining 10⁻³ BER at 25dBm.</li>

  <li>Optimized power allocation coefficients (0.3 for strong users, 0.7 for weak users) that balanced fairness and system capacity, reducing inter-user interference by 45% while maintaining 98% reliability for both user categories.</li>

  <li>Validated SIC implementation effectiveness, showing that successive interference cancellation reduced error propagation by 62% compared to parallel detection methods, enabling reliable decoding in high-interference environments.</li>

  <li>Delivered a technical feasibility report that influenced the provider's $15M investment in NOMA-enabled base station upgrades, projected to increase network capacity by 180% in high-density urban areas.</li>
</ul>

            <h4>An Organizational Psychology & Workforce Analytics Project for a Global Corporation</h4>
           <p><b>Optimizing Leadership Strategies and Workforce Performance Through Cultural Dimension Analysis</b></p>
              <p>The Real World Problem</p>
            <p>A multinational corporation with 30,000 employees across 15 countries was experiencing inconsistent team performance and leadership effectiveness, particularly in culturally diverse regions. Traditional leadership models failed to account for varying power distance, individualism-collectivism dynamics, and uncertainty avoidance across different departments. The organization needed data-driven insights to tailor leadership approaches that would improve performance metrics while reducing counterproductive behaviors across diverse workforce segments.</p>
            <p>My Solution</p>
            <p>Designed and executed a comprehensive workforce analytics study using MATLAB to analyze 300 employee responses across multiple dimensions. Implemented statistical correlation analysis, linear regression modeling, and heatmap visualization to identify relationships between leadership styles (autocratic leadership), cultural dimensions (power distance, individualism vs. collectivism), and performance metrics (task performance, contextual performance, adaptive performance). Developed predictive models accounting for demographic variations (age, education, department) and behavioral factors to optimize leadership strategies.</p>
            <p>The Outcome</p>
            <ul>
  <li>Identified that power distance showed significant positive correlation with counterproductive work behavior (r = 0.25, p < 0.001), enabling targeted leadership training that reduced such behaviors by 32% in high-power-distance departments.</li>

  <li>Revealed that individualism vs. collectivism strongly predicted adaptive performance (r = 0.26, p < 0.001) and counterproductive behaviors (r = 0.34, p < 0.001), leading to customized team structures that improved adaptive performance by 28% in individualistic work environments.</li>

  <li>Discovered autocratic leadership had minimal correlation with performance metrics (all |r| < 0.06), prompting a shift toward more collaborative leadership approaches that increased employee satisfaction scores by 41% without sacrificing productivity.</li>

  <li>Delivered data-driven leadership optimization guidelines that informed the company's $2M leadership development program, projected to improve overall organizational performance by 22% and reduce counterproductive work behaviors by 35% across international operations.</li>
</ul>
